## Logistic Regression Classification
Logistic regression is a classification technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics. Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The intention behind using logistic regression is to find the best fitting model to describe the relationship between the dependent and the independent variable.

Where   
 b = Coefficieant  
 X = variable
## Check Score of model
For checking effeciency of model we have used Confusion Matrix. It is show the effeciency in matrix form.

Sensitivity tells us what proportion of the positive class got correctly classified.

**Specificity / True Negative Rate**  
**Specificity formula**
